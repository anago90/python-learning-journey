## Project: Tinker AI Hands-On Development
**Goal:** Build practical Python skills through AI-powered application development

## Setup Process
Following [Tinker-Docs](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/) and chatGPT, I configured:
- Python version management (correct version for Tinker compatibility)
- SDK installation and configuration
- API integration attempt with ThinkingMachines.AI (blocked due to account credit limitations)
- Dependency troubleshooting

## Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge:** Version compatibility issues between Python, SDK, and Tinker
**Solution:** Used AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude) to troubleshoot and identify correct dependency versions

**Challenge:** Unclear setup instructions in documentation
**Solution:** Cross-referenced community resources and AI assistance

**Challenge:** Unable to complete API integration due to missing account credits  
**Solution:** Diagnosed error source and deferred integration until credits are available

## Learning Outcomes
- Environment setup and configuration management
- Technical documentation testing and validation
- AI-augmented troubleshooting workflows
- Understanding of Python project structure and dependencies

## Next Steps
tinker-work (local workspace)

## Hands-On Work
Planned hands-on workspace for Python experiments and modular Tinker development.
Repository will be added once the initial runnable modules are created.
