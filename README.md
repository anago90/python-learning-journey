## Project: Tinker AI Hands-On Development
**Goal:** Build practical Python skills through AI-powered application development

## Setup Process
Following [Tinker-Docs](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/) and chatGPT, I configured:
- Python version management (correct version for Tinker compatibility)
- SDK installation and configuration
- API integration with ThinkingMachines.AI
- Dependency troubleshooting

## Challenges & Solutions
**Challenge:** Version compatibility issues between Python, SDK, and Tinker
**Solution:** Used AI tools (ChatGPT/Claude) to troubleshoot and identify correct dependency versions

**Challenge:** Unclear setup instructions in documentation
**Solution:** Cross-referenced community resources and AI assistance

## Learning Outcomes
- Environment setup and configuration management
- Technical documentation testing and validation
- AI-augmented troubleshooting workflows
- Understanding of Python project structure and dependencies

## Next Steps
